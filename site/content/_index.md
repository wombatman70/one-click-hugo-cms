    You’ll love this stately, 2-story brick home on 2 acres only 5 minutes from
    Downtown Grand Rapids! This 4-bedroom, 1.5-bathroom home has over 2,400 sq.
    ft. of space, without losing that quaint, cozy atmosphere when it’s time to
    cuddle up by the fireplace with a good book. 

    The 3-stall garage/man cave is ready to store a classic car, be ”brew
    central” for beer brewing, or the hub of projects. This home has much to
    offer the Grand Rapids professional looking to be close to work - a place to
    entertain friends, family and associates; a chance to put their own unique
    updates on a historic piece of Grand Rapids. Built in 1930, this home has
    all the majors completed and is ready for a new owner to make it their own!
